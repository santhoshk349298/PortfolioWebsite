        &emsp;Hi, I'm Christopher Venczel, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Ottawa. I'm passionate about web app development and enjoy exploring data visualization and analysis. This website is a portfolio of some of the interactive Javascript projects I have created using the <a class="basicLink" target="_blank" href="https://p5js.org/">P5JS</a> library.
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
        &emsp;The projects feature a variety of different things that interest me including Music ðŸŽµ, Design ðŸŽ¨, Math ðŸ“ˆ, Physics ðŸš€, and AI ðŸ§ .
        The code for the projects as well as for the website is open-source under the GNU General Public Licence and can be found on my Github 
        <a target="_blank" class="basicLink" href="https://github.com/chrisvenczel/PortfolioWebsite">here</a>.
